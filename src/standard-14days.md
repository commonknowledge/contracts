    2.  The proposal Go Free Range provides will contain:

        1.  A description of the Work;
        2.  An indication of when the Work will begin and end;
        3.  An estimate of how much staff time the Work will require;
        4.  Our fees;

            and agreed prior to the commencement of the Work.

4. ### The Work

    1.  Go Free Range will complete the Work as described in the proposal.
    2.  At any time, you may request that some aspect of the Work
        be changed. Go Free Range will make reasonable efforts to comply
        with that request.
    3.  If the Work changes, Go Free Range may charge additional fees. We will
        agree any such fees with you before proceeding further with
        the Work.
    4.  When we believe the Work has been completed, we will show you
        the Work, and ask for your feedback.
    5.  If you send us feedback, we will (at no extra charge) spend
        more time on the Work, up to a maximum of 15% of the staff
        time estimated in the proposal.
    6.  If you require further changes after this time has been spent,
        Go Free Range will provide a proposal for a new piece of Work.

5. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to complete the Work, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.

        not be able to complete the Work within the deadlines specified
        in the proposal.

6. ### Subcontracting

    1.  At Go Free Range's sole discretion, freelancers or contractors may be used
        in place of Go Free Range employees in order to complete some or all of the Work.

    1.  Go Free Range will deliver the Work to a professional standard.
    2.  Go Free Range is insured against professional negligence to a value of
        Â£1,000,000 (the "insured sum"). We would be willing to negotiate an
        increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to pass
        on any corresponding increase in the premium.

8. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  Go Free Range cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  Go Free Range will deliver Work that is as robust and reliable as is
        reasonably practical.

        that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of the Work.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. Go Free Range can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, Go Free Range's total liability under this agreement is

    4.  We grant you a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence
        to the Reused IP for their use in the Product.

        you, you agree to grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
        royalty-free licence that authorises this use.
