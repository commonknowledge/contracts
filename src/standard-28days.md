    1.  Before starting the Work, Common Knowledge will provide a proposal.
    2.  The proposal Common Knowledge provides will contain:

        1.  A description of the Work;
        2.  An indication of when the Work will begin and end;
        3.  An estimate of how much staff time the Work will require;
        4.  Our fees;

            and agreed prior to the commencement of the Work.

4. ### The Work

    1.  Common Knowledge will complete the Work as described in the proposal.
    2.  At any time, you may request that some aspect of the Work
        be changed. Common Knowledge will make reasonable efforts to comply
        with that request.
    3.  If the Work changes, Common Knowledge may charge additional fees. We will
        agree any such fees with you before proceeding further with
        the Work.
    4.  When we believe the Work has been completed, we will show you
        the Work, and ask for your feedback.
    5.  If you send us feedback, we will (at no extra charge) spend
        more time on the Work, up to a maximum of 15% of the staff
        time estimated in the proposal.
    6.  If you require further changes after this time has been spent,
        Common Knowledge will provide a proposal for a new piece of Work.

5. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to complete the Work, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If Common Knowledge does not have the Required Materials promptly, we may
        not be able to complete the Work within the deadlines specified
        in the proposal.

6. ### Subcontracting

    1.  At Common Knowledge's sole discretion, freelancers or contractors may be used
        in place of Common Knowledge employees in order to complete some or all of the Work.
    2.  Common Knowledge will not outsource the Work without your prior agreement, which
        must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

7. ### Quality

    1.  Common Knowledge will deliver the Work to a professional standard.
    2.  Common Knowledge is insured against professional negligence to a value of
        £1,000,000 (the "insured sum"). We would be willing to negotiate an
        increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to pass
        on any corresponding increase in the premium.

8. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  Common Knowledge cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  Common Knowledge will deliver Work that is as robust and reliable as is
        reasonably practical.
    4.  Common Knowledge will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation
        that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of the Work.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. Common Knowledge can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, Common Knowledge's total liability under this agreement is
        limited to the lesser of:

        1. The fee for the Work.
        2. The insured sum.

9. ### Confidentiality

    1.  Common Knowledge believe that it is best to be open.
    2.  Common Knowledge will generally not keep the details of the Work
        confidential, including but not limited to:

        2.  The nature and goals of the Work;
        3.  The Work's likely completion date(s);
        4.  The fee for the Work.

    3.  However, Common Knowledge do regard the following as confidential:

        1.  The specific content of documents or copy that will be
            published on any of your websites that is not yet publicly
            available, most especially the content of forthcoming
            strategy or policy announcements;
        2.  Personal data Common Knowledge acquires during the course of the Work;
        3.  The content or existence of any document you send to us that
            is protectively marked.

    4.  If you have additional confidentiality requirements, you must tell
        us in writing as soon as is reasonably practical.

10. ### Intellectual property

    1.  Intellectual property in work created by us in the course of working on
        a Project and that also forms a part of the Product ("Project IP") shall,
        (as a future assignment of intellectual property) belong to you, subject
        to the licences set out in this agreement.
    2.  "Background IP" means any intellectual property used in the Product that
        is not Project IP and "Reused IP" means any Background IP which we own.
    3.  You do not become the owner of any Background IP.
    4.  We grant you a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence
        to the Reused IP for their use in the Product.
    5.  We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that Background IP that is
        not Reused IP is licensed in such a way that you are able to make use of
        it as part of the Product.
    6.  Common Knowledge may place links or representative screenshots of the materials we create
        for our clients along with their names or logos on a Common Knowledge website or within
        other promotional material. To the extent that these materials are owned by
        you, you agree to grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
        royalty-free licence that authorises this use.
    7. We are neither able to enumerate the intellectual property your Product
        contains, nor to state which parts are owned by you and which are Project
        IP or Reused IP.

11. ### Payments

        as described in the proposal.

        the notice Common Knowledge sends you.
